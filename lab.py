Welcome to Luitel Lab, a cutting-edge biotechnology research facility located in Nepal.
The laboratory was established in 2010 and since then, we have been working towards improving animal and plant health through biotechnology.
Our lab is dedicated to advancing the field of biotechnology and improving human life through innovative scientific research.
"""

homepage_intro_2 = """
With a team of highly skilled and dedicated scientists, we are at the forefront of discovery in a wide range 
of biotechnology areas, from developing new vaccines and treatments for diseases, to creating sustainable agricultural 
solutions and improving food security.
Our main research areas of interest include Molecular Diagnostics, Animal Forensics, Reproductive Biotechnology, 
and Animal Genomics.
Under Molecular Diagnostics, we are working on the detection, isolation, and characterization of pathogens in both 
plants and animals to develop rapid diagnostic tools. We are also focused on characterizing livestock breeds and their 
relationship with traits of economic importance. Our state-of-the-art facility is equipped with the latest technologies and tools, 
allowing us to conduct cutting-edge research and achieve breakthrough results.
"""
